##What we have done##

* First we configured a git repository and added us as collabrateurs
* We then pulled the repo each
* Edited the .gitconfig and .bashrc to get additional output
* Also we activated color in the output of git
* We went on to create merge-conflicts
* Next we forked the git repository of another group
* The git ssh-keys were added to our accounts, because retyping account-details every time is annoying
